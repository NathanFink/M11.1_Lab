# M11.1 Lab

## Overview

This project builds on our AWS and creates a webpage using the endpoint we created last lab, we create a table and add items with proper ids, prices and names. This is done with some text fields and buttons to send data to the api. We need to be able to access each item by id so that they can be deleted. With each item added to the list there is a delete button associated with the item.
